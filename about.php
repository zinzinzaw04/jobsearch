            <p>Golden Future first step was Telegram Channel. Golden Future Telegram Channel was opened in May 7, 2021. And in over 20 days, it gained almost 50,000 subscribers. To Share more Job Vacancies, Golden Future Facebook Page was opened in May 27, 2021. Over the next 4 months, Golden Future Facebook Page gained almost 150,000 Likes and Followers.</p>
            <p>Golden Future became more and more successful and Employers became more aware of Golden Future. At that time, many business owners also sent Job Offers to Golden Future. But we did not stop trying for Golden Future. So, Golden Future LinkedIn Page was opened in Oct 24, 2021. LinkedIn HR and Business Owners are also sending their job vacancies.</p>
            <p>Many job applications are being sent to Golden Future. And we review job applications whether include the company name, address and contact email. If the information is incomplete, we ask the business owners and HR to return the required information. And only complete jobs are uploaded to the Golden Future Platform.</p>
            <p>Golden Future admin Team are trying to get more companies from different fields to contact Golden Future. Golden Future Admin Manpower was very tired because of this step-by-step effort. Then we tried to create a website where business owners could submit their own job vacancies.</p>
